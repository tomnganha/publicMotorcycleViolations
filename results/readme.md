# Results
Our test set [link] consists of 310 images, where 260 are from the filtered IDD Dataset (as mentioned in this [paper]) and 50 are randomly chosen images from web search to enrich the testing for rare triple-riding violations.

The results are divided into 2 parts one for triple-riding violations and other for helmet violations.
